A pluto notebook on turbulence modeling for a 1D atmospheric boundary layer, made for educational purposes during Professor A. Edelman's class, "Julia: Solving Real-World Problems with Computation" at MIT.
The content in the notebook is based on material learned in Professor M. Howland's class, "Atmospheric Boundary Layer Flows and Wind Energy" at MIT. 
It is an introductory lesson designed for students who have little or no background in fluid mechanics but are interested in how atmospheric models represent the effects of turbulence.

Three eddy viscosity models are implemented: (1) constant eddy viscosity model, (2) mixing length eddy viscosity model, and (3) a simplified Yonsei University (YSU) model.

All questions, comments, and feedback are welcome and may be addressed to: youngin@mit.edu.
